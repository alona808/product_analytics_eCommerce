# Product Analytics Metrics in E-Commerce

In this project, we will explore various product analytics metrics in the
context of e-commerce. We will analyze data related to customer behavior, sales
performance, and product performance to gain insights and make data-driven
decisions.

Throughout the project, we will utilize various data analysis techniques and
tools to extract insights from the available data. By the end, we aim to provide
actionable recommendations to improve the overall performance of the e-commerce
business.

The result of this project is an annual product summary report and dashboard
